# databox-store-hls-video

> Databox store for transcoding video and streaming as HLS.

A Databox store for storage of video files that transcodes uploaded videos
and makes them available as an [HLS](https://developer.apple.com/streaming/)
stream.

## Development setup

experiment without using the Docker install on your development machine, a
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) environment is also included which
contains a minimal environment with Docker installed.
